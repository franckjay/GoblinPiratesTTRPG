# PIRATE GOBLINS! A Game of Cosmic Plunder and High-Seas Hijinks
Welcome Aboard, Ya Scallywags!
You are all Pirate Goblins, congratulations! You are also hurtling through the sea aboard your beloved (and questionably held together) pirate ship. Your goal? To amass as much treasure, loot, and infamy as possible while surviving the dangers of the ocean!
## What You Need:
● Index cards or paper for character and ship notes
● Writing utensils
● Multiple 6-sided (d6) and 8-sided (d8) dice
● Various tokens—at least 15—for tracking Crew Morale
● 40+ building blocks (like LEGO) to represent your Ship’s hull and upgrades
## Game Master (GM)
Unlike the original Space Goblins! structure, Pirate Goblins! features a dedicated Game Master (GM) who controls the galaxy, narrates events, and referees combat. The GM describes targets, resolves ship battles, and creates unexpected challenges for the crew. They also play opposing ships, enemy crews, and any space authorities who might try to interfere.
### Crew Morale
Your Crew Morale is the collective energy and camaraderie keeping your band of misfits together. Every time a goblin suffers a setback, fails a dangerous task, or is forced to retreat, Morale takes a hit. If Morale reaches 0, the crew turns against itself, ending the game in a mutiny!
Morale starts at 10 and resets after each successful Plunder Phase.
### Character Creation
Each player creates their own Pirate Goblin by filling out the following:
1. Name: Pick a suitably gobliny name.
2. Look & Style: Describe your goblin’s clothing, wild features, or cybernetic enhancements.
3. Traits: Distribute 3 points among the following stats:
○ Strength: Good at physical combat and breaking things.
○ Cunning: Good at deception, trickery, and sneaky maneuvers.
○ Marksmanship: Good at shooting, throwing, and ranged combat.
4. Signature Loot: Choose one item your goblin always carries (e.g., a rusty cutlass, a lucky bone, or a stolen noble’s hat).
Your goblin’s stats will be used in boarding actions, heists, and other daring escapades!
### Your Ship
Your pirate ship is your home, weapon, and getaway plan all in one. Built from salvaged parts and stolen components, its hull is mostly intact. It can be upgraded, repaired, and customized, but beware—too much damage, and you may be stranded in the void!
Your ship starts with a Hull Integrity of 20 (or 30 for 4+ players).
Each goblin contributes 1 point at a time (rotating turns) to the following ship traits:
● Hull: How sturdy the ship is
● Speed: How quickly the ship maneuvers
● Cannons: How dangerous the ship’s weapons are
● Trickery: How well the ship deceives enemies
Whenever the ship takes damage, remove blocks from the ship’s physical model. If it ever reaches 0, it falls apart, stranding the crew!
# Phases of Play
Each game session consists of three repeating phases: Sail! (Travel), Raid! (Ship-to-Ship Combat & Boarding), and Plunder! (Loot & Repair).
## 1. Sail! (Travel Phase)
Your ship is moving through the galaxy, searching for new targets! Each goblin chooses one action for this phase:
● Spy a Target: Roll 2d6. A 10+ means you find an especially rich target! A 7-9 is an average ship. A 6 or less means a weak ship—or an ambush!
● Repair the Ship: Spend 10 Loot to restore Hull by 1.
● Train the Crew: Improve Morale by 1 (max 10).
● Upgrade the Ship: Spend 20 Loot to increase one ship stat by 1.
## 2. Raid! (Ship-to-Ship Combat & Boarding)
Once a target has been found, it's time for battle! This phase has two parts: Ship-to-Ship Combat and Boarding.
### Ship-to-Ship Combat
Before boarding, the two ships must engage in a chaotic firefight! The GM determines the opposing ship’s stats and describes the battle, then each side takes turns attacking.
● Each ship has Hull (Health), Cannons (Attack), Speed (Evasion), and Trickery (Deception).
● The attacking ship rolls 2d6 + Cannons, trying to match or exceed the opponent’s Hull Integrity.
● The defending ship may counter with Speed (to evade), Counterattack or Trickery (to outmaneuver) by rolling 2d6 + their chosen stat. If they roll higher than the attack roll, the attack is avoided.
*** If the roll is a 12 or higher, the enemy ship can Flee, completely outmaneuver, or repel (via Counterattack) the Goblin attackers, thus ending the battle.
● Successful attacks deal 1-3 damage based on the difference in rolls.
* Successful Counterattacks can damage the Goblin ship by the difference in rolls
● Once a ship reaches 5 or fewer Hull, it is vulnerable to being boarded!
### Boarding Combat
If the enemy ship is vulnerable, goblins may leap aboard for melee combat! At this point, each goblin fights enemy crew members one-on-one.
● Enemy crew members have a Difficulty Score (DS) based on their strength:
○ Weak Crew: DS 8
○ Well-Trained Fighters: DS 10
○ Elite Captain & Officers: DS 12
● Each goblin rolls 2d6 + their relevant stat (Strength, Cunning, or Marksmanship). Success means damage is dealt to the enemy’s DS, while failure results in lost Morale.
● If the DS reaches 0, the ship is fully subdued, and the goblins win!
## 3. Plunder! (Loot & Repair Phase)
After a successful raid, the goblins collect their loot and upgrade their ship. Each goblin rolls a Loot Die (based on ship size):
● Small Ship: d6 Loot each
● Medium Ship: d8 Loot each
● Treasure Galleon: d10 Loot each
Loot can be spent on repairs, upgrades, or bribing local authorities.
Then, the cycle repeats!

# Finale: Epic Ending
After less than 8 cycles, the game concludes with one final Boss Encounter—a dreaded Navy fleet, a rival pirate lord, or a monstrous sea leviathan! The goblins must either fight, flee, or trick their way to ultimate victory.
Survive, and your exploits will become legend across the seas!
Long Live the Pirate Goblins!
